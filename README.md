🧠 Face Recognition Attendance System

A robust web-based attendance system that uses facial recognition powered by deep learning to authenticate individuals and automatically record attendance. Ideal for colleges, classrooms, workplaces, and events, this project delivers high accuracy and automation with a user-friendly interface.

🚀 Overview

This system leverages powerful face detection and recognition models to:

Identify registered users

Automatically mark attendance

Provide role-based dashboards for Admins and Lecturers

During student registration, the app captures multiple facial images to ensure high accuracy across lighting conditions and angles.

Perfect for:

Final-year college projects

AI + Web development portfolios

Backend system demonstrations

Deploying in institutions for real-time attendance
